\chapter*{Event Structures}

We want to explore ``double-sided'' Event Structures as a foundation for
Quantum Relativity.

Winskel's definition of Event Structures is \emph{explicitly} ``one-sided'' in
that the associated configurations \emph{must} be both finite and down-closed.
Effectively they \emph{must} have a ``begining''.

Effectively, in Quantum Relativity, Cosmology and The Big-Bang aside, there is
no ``begining''. That is we want to look at Quantum Relativity as a
\emph{process} with (potentially) no begining and no end.

An event structure provides \emph{a} relativistic structure. We explore this
anology by looking at:

\begin{itemize}
  \item light cones, both future and past,
  \item spatial surfaces orthogonal to time
\end{itemize}

We also want to explore the adjunction (name?) between ColoredPetriNets and
EventStructures.
