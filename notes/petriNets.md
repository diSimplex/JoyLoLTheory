We are primarily interested in *Coloured* Petri Nets as models of JoyLoL code.

## Problems

We need to investigate *invertible* Petri nets. That is Petri nets which do not "lose" information about the computation they represent.

**Why?** Because they provide a template for double sided event structures... see a paper I recently read.... (**WHICH!!!**)
