title: The theory of JoyLoL
tags: 

Our penultimate objective is to provide a *computational* basis for Quantum Relativity. (Our ultimate objective is to understand why babies babble... but that is another story).

We base our initial analysis of Quantum Relativity on the work of [Glynn Winskel](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~gw104/). Principally his understanding of (causal and concurrent) [Event Structures](/eventStructures).

For the *theory* of JoyLoL we are primarily interested in "pulling" the parallelism of [Concurrent Strategies](/concurrentStrategies) (particular types of event structures) back into the JoyLoL language.
