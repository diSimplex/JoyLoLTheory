title: Event Structures

Event Structures are 

* causal
* concurrent or parallel.
* the unfolding of (conditionless) [Petri Nets](/petriNets)

For the *theory* of JoyLoL we are primarily interested in "pulling" the parallelism of [Concurrent Strategies](/concurrentStrategies) (particular types of event structures) back into the JoyLoL language.

## Problems

The *problem* with Event Structures as they are currently formulated is that they are "one sided". They only look into the *future* and (by and large) do not capture the "past". To provide a foundation for Quantum Relativity, we *must* have double sided event structures which capture the structure of *processes* which might have been "running" for an indefinite amount of time.
