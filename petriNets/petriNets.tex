\lpilChapter{pn}{Petri Nets}

We take a heavily Categorical approach.

We begin by looking at the category of MultiSets and then develop the category
of ColoredPetriNets.

However, while most discussions of PetriNets assume an ``initial
configuration'', we are \emph{explicitly} interested in the nature of PetriNets
as \emph{processes} which may or may not have an initial starting point in
``time''.

We are interested in exploring the ``unfolding'' adjunction in the category of
PetriNets. Typically we think of unfolding as unfolding in ``time'' (and
possibly only implicitly unfolding in ``space''). In this work, we
\emph{explicitly} want to explore this unfolding in \emph{both} ``time''
\emph{and} ``space''.

We are interested in exploring PetriNets as presheaves of ???.

We generally follow Winskel \cite{keylist}.
